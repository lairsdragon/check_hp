Version 2.20
============
Quick progress these days... as of Andrew Gray's inquiry I added support for
retrieving Smart Array CPU information. This is not active by default and may
be used to check and/or gather performance data.

As usual I cleaned some code parts. This time there are some improvements to
the output of '--help' and more important to the output of the debug switch
('-d|--debug'). Enjoy!


Version 2.19
============
The plugin now displays some product information like model, serial number,
form factor and asset tag (if given). Thanks to Billy Szkoda for asking for
this feature!

Some minor code cleanup done in between.

Please note: this information is now retrieved by default on every query. If
you don't need or don't like the idea, or you'd rather have higher performance
on a big network, just skip this using '-x cpqSystemInfo' and you'll get the
behaviour as it was before.


Version 2.18
============
Updated state information for newer generations of HP equipment. Thanks to
Jason Wasser who pointet out an error and by debugging helped discover the
missing information provided by new Gen9 servers. This release now includes
the latest MIBS as they are freely available with the HP SIM 7.4 release.
Last not least, after Jason pointed this out, the /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins
folder is now automatically searched as well.


Version 2.17
============
Added check for a Drive Array's accelerator condition as suggested by Robert
Brooks. Thanks!


Version 2.16
============
REALLY fixes broken versions 2.14 + 2.15 (automatic lib-folder discovery).


Version 2.15
============
Fixes broken version 2.14 (change introducing automatic lib-folder discovery).


Version 2.14
============
Thanks this time to an improvement by Steffen Weinreich who added a parameter
that allow "requiring" the presence of some subsystems (they not being there
during the check being the issue at hand). Use it by specifying the following:

  -r subsystem1,subsystem2,...


Version 2.13
============
Many thanks to Rod Payne, Buffalo NY, for the current addition. He suggested it
would be helpful to specify particular values that should be treated as
warnings. Specifically this could mean that instead of treating all NIC logical
group problems as warnings, he would want to make “redundancyReduced” a warning
and leave “redundancyLost” as critical. He extended the code to allow the
warning exception to be more specific using the following syntax:

  -w cpqNicIfLogMapStatus=6


Version 2.12
============
Got a few nice inputs from George Hansper, who thought it better to indicate
more details about single component units in order to have the possibility to
exclude some specific device (maybe not a best practice to be followed, but
nevertheless a valid requirement in some specific and possibly temporary cases).


Version 2.11
============
Some more testing done by Martin Boer together with some nice feedback on how
to shorten down and beautify the code:

- replaced a lot of silly 'elsif' statements with a single (but safe) 'eval'
- introduced a '-w' parameter to set some failures to WARNING states instead
  of CRITICAL since "you don't consider a bad disk in a RAID configuration
  necessarily something you want to find out in the middle of the night"


Version 2.10
============
Some changes include:

- definitions now moved into a hash of hashes instead of different arrays
- some cleanup to the '--help' parameter (now hinted at when none is given)
- added an '--exclude' parameter for different checks as requested by 'Mastrboy'


Version 2.9
===========
Thanks again to Jean Prat for:

- adding cpqNicIfLogMapStatus
- adding cpqNicIfPhysAdapterStatus
- giving component names a more readable form


Version 2.8
===========
One more issue fixed with the cpqHeEventLogCondition. Thanks to Seth Rice for
his support while debugging.


Version 2.7
===========
Minor bug introduced by the cpqHeResilientMemCondition check should now be ok.
This comes together with some small cleanup around that part.

Thanks to Peter Tauber for pointing it out and verifying.


Version 2.6
===========
Thanks and credits to Milan Karalic for cpqHeResilientMemCondition!

Major thanks to Jean Prat for the "few" things that follow here:

 - debug printout for inexistent OID-trees
 - support for cpqDaTapeDrvStatus (tape drives)
 - support for cpqHeEventLogCondition (event log)
 - support for cpqFcaHostCntlrStatus (fibre channel components)

Code indentation cleanup for the parts taken from check_ifoperstatus.


Version 2.5
===========
Minor fix for a bug I introduced when putting this under version control.
Now it should all work nicely again.


Version 2.4
===========
The plugin has now been put under version control and a proper ChangeLog is
included.


Version 2.3
===========
The README now includes documentation about all requirements:

 - path to nagios-plugins “utils.pm”
 - the distribution’s “libsnmp-perl” package if you are missing Net/SNMP.pm


Version 2.2
===========
A minor update:

 - one typo fixed, which would have prevented the output of the actual state of
   physical drives (the error itself would have been reported)
 - the README now includes a hint about the debug option “-d”, which is not
   intended to be used in production


Version 2.1
===========
This is mainly the same as version 2 (see below), except it now handles a
counter for every hardware component checked. If zero values are returned by
the snmp agent, the plugin exits with a WARNING state.


Version 2.0
===========
First release of this all-perl, mib-translation-table-free, all-in-one
version.

Check CPUs, fans, array controllers, logical / physical drives, temperature
and power supplies on your Proliant servers or blade systems through SNMP.

The plugin uses Compaq/HPs Insight Manager SNMP Agents installed on either
Windows or Linux machines to check CPUs, fans, array controllers, logical /
physical drives, temperature and power supplies on your Proliant servers or
blade systems.

Compaq MIBs are included in the attached archive. The new version 2 is a
complete rewrite in Perl and only uses the OID-Trees, so you don’t need to add
the Compaq MIBs to your local configuration.
